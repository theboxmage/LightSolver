# LightSolver
This was a mistake, but I have friends to show it to

Solves those 3x3 click the light puzzle games where clicking a light toggles adjacent (non-diagonal) squares.

Current input is not smart, and maybe it should be. In Main.kt set both the input for initial state, and solution for end state. Prints the (minimum?) amount of required moves as well as the count of moves.
